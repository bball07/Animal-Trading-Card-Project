			<p>The Mandarin fish is a popular salt water fish that is hard to keep
            as a pet because of its unique diet of worms, fish eggs, gastropods,
            and copepods.It is also one of only two confirmed spiecies that
            produces its own unique blue colouring.The Mandarin fish is
            covered in tiny spikes that secrete a very toxic mucus. The 
            Mandarin fish also does not have scales. You can find this
            fish in the Pacific Ocean, Japan, and Australia.</p>
